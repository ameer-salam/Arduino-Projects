# Serial Monitor Commands and Their Meanings

## Program: testing_moisture_and_water_level_sensor

This program is used for testing the sensor values and calibrating the thresholds manually. It does not include any commands as it continuously prints sensor values to the Serial Monitor.

## Program: testing_moisture_and_water_level_sensor_v2

This program includes commands to control two motors using relays. Below are the commands you can type into the Serial Monitor and their respective functions:

- **"m on"**:
  - **Function**: Turns both the borewell motor and the tank motor on.
  - **Example**: `m on`

- **"m1 on"**:
  - **Function**: Turns the borewell motor on.
  - **Example**: `m1 on`

- **"m1 off"**:
  - **Function**: Turns the borewell motor off.
  - **Example**: `m1 off`

- **"m2 on"**:
  - **Function**: Turns the tank motor on.
  - **Example**: `m2 on`

- **"m2 off"**:
  - **Function**: Turns the tank motor off.
  - **Example**: `m2 off`

- **"help"**:
  - **Function**: Prints a list of available commands.
  - **Example**: `help`

### Command Usage

1. **Open the Serial Monitor** in the Arduino IDE.
2. **Set the Baud Rate** to `9600`.
3. **Enter Commands** as described above to control the motors.

Ensure that the relay type (`relayType`) is correctly set in the code before uploading it to your Arduino. Refer to the code comments for further details on configuring the relay type.
