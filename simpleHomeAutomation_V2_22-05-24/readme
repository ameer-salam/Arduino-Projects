# Bluetooth-Controlled Home Automation with Arduino

This project enables control of various household devices using an Arduino board and an HC-05 Bluetooth module. You can control a light, a table lamp, a fan, and a door lock mechanism via Bluetooth commands sent from a mobile device.

## Features
- Turn the light on/off.
- Control the table lamp: on/off.
- Activate/deactivate the fan.
- Open/close the door lock.

## Components Required
- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- HC-05 Bluetooth module
- Servo motor
- Relay module (for controlling the fan)
- LEDs and resistors (for simulating light and table lamp)

## Instructions
1. Connect the components according to the circuit diagram.
2. Upload the provided Arduino sketch to your Arduino board.
3. Power up the Arduino board.
4. Pair the HC-05 Bluetooth module with your mobile device.
5. Install a Bluetooth terminal app on your mobile device.
6. Send commands (e.g., "light on", "fan off") via the Bluetooth terminal app to control the devices.

## How it Works
- The Arduino board receives commands via the HC-05 Bluetooth module.
- Each command corresponds to a specific action: turning devices on/off or controlling the door lock.
- The Arduino board communicates with the devices (light, lamp, fan, servo motor) to execute the requested actions.

## Additional Notes
- Ensure proper power supply to the Arduino board and components.
- Use appropriate voltage levels and resistors to prevent damage to the components.
- Test the circuit and code in a controlled environment before deployment.
